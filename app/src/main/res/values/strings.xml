    <string name="second_article">  Many a time a lot of women fidget about the body transformations that will occur during their pregnancy periods. Some even go as far as delaying getting pregnant because of this issue. While this kind of body transformations are inevitable and vary from women to women,you are not meant to be ashamed of them.

            There are three stages of pregnancy every woman must pass through, namely: first trimester(conception to 12 weeks), second trimester(13 to 27 weeks),  third trimester (28 to 40 weeks). With each trimester comes a fairly distinct kind of transformation your body must go throughFirst trimester:In the first trimester, your baby\'s little body starts taking shape, and all those tiny organs begin to form. Meanwhile, your own body goes through some pretty big adjustments too. You might notice things like feeling queasy, super tired, and making more trips to the bathroom than usual. This stage is mostly filled with a lot of emotional and physical changes, which can be overwhelming (especially for the first timers). Furthermore, your hormones tend to be hyperactive during this stage, thereby contributing to these unpleasant pregnancy symptoms(such as frequent mood swings ) you will be experiencing.

In addition, the veins on your breasts become more noticeable. Also, you need to consider wearing bigger clothes to prevent tightening your body.
